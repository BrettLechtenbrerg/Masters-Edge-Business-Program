# Hiring Decision Framework
## The Hiring Oracle - When to Hire, Pass, or Dig Deeper

---

## Overview

**Purpose:** Provide a structured decision-making framework to help you confidently decide whether to hire, pass, or explore further - reducing the risk of both bad hires and missed opportunities.

**When to Use:** After completing interviews and reference checks, when you're ready to make a decision.

**Why It Matters:** The cost of a bad hire is 1.5-3x their salary. The cost of missing a great candidate is immeasurable. This framework helps you get it right.

### Confidence Levels for Hire

| Confidence | What It Means | What to Do |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| **90-100%** | "I'm certain" | Move quickly - they'll have other options |
| **75-89%** | "Very confident" | Proceed with normal timeline |
| **60-74%** | "Fairly confident" | Consider one more data point |
| **Below 60%** | "Not confident enough" | This is actually "Explore More" |

### The "Hell Yes" Test

```
Ask yourself: "Is this person a HELL YES?"

┌─────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Your Answer     │ What It Means                                  │
├─────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ "HELL YES!"     │ Hire. Move quickly.                           │
│ "Yes, I think"  │ Probably hire, but why the hesitation?        │
│ "Pretty good"   │ Explore more. What would make it "hell yes"?  │
│ "Maybe/Okay"    │ Probably pass. Why are you settling?          │
│ "I guess"       │ Pass. You're not excited enough.              │
└─────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Note: You don't need "hell yes" for every dimension.
But you DO need it for Values Fit, or problems are inevitable.

### Clear Pass Situations

| Situation | Why It's a Pass |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Values score of 1 in any area | Values can't be trained |
| Dishonesty detected | Trust is foundational |
| Reference declined or refused | What are they hiding? |
| Badmouthed previous employers | They'll do it to you |
| Couldn't give any specific examples | Likely exaggerating experience |
| Multiple red flags across dimensions | Pattern of concern |
| Your team strongly objects | They have to work together |
| You keep trying to convince yourself | You shouldn't have to |

### The "Would You Bet?" Test

```
Ask yourself: "Would I bet a meaningful amount of money that this
person will succeed in this role for at least 2 years?"

If the answer is "no" or "I'm not sure" → You're not confident enough

Remember: Every hire IS a bet. A bad hire costs $50K-$150K+.
You're betting that money whether you think of it that way or not.

### Valid "Explore More" Actions

| If You Need... | Do This... |
|----------------|------------|
| Skills validation | Give a practical exercise or test |
| Team fit check | Conduct team interview |
| Concern clarification | Second interview focused on concern |
| Better reference | Request additional reference |
| Peer perspective | Have them meet peers informally |
| Leadership assessment | Add leadership interview |
| Technical depth | Technical interview with expert |

### The "Explore More" Trap

```
⚠️ WARNING: "Explore More" can be a trap to avoid deciding.

CHECK YOURSELF:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

□ Can I articulate the SPECIFIC question I need answered?
  If no → You're avoiding a decision

□ Will the answer actually change my decision?
  If no → You're avoiding a decision

□ Am I just hoping the concern will go away?
  If yes → You're avoiding a decision

□ Have I already done multiple rounds of "explore more"?
  If yes → It's time to decide

The Rule: One round of "explore more" is healthy.
         Two rounds means you should probably pass.

## Special Decision Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The "Almost" Candidate

```
SITUATION:
They're good but not great. You could see it working, but you're
not excited. Score is solid 3s across the board.

GUIDANCE:
• "Almost" usually means "No" for key roles
• Ask: "If I wait, might I find someone better?"
• Ask: "Am I settling because I'm tired of searching?"
• For senior roles: Pass and keep looking
• For junior roles: May be acceptable if trainable

DECISION PROMPT:
"If a clearly better candidate appeared tomorrow,
would I regret this hire?" If yes → Pass or Wait
```

### Scenario 2: The "Diamond in the Rough"

```
SITUATION:
Lacks experience or polish but has raw potential.
Strong values and attitude, skills need development.

GUIDANCE:
• Values + Attitude + Intelligence = Trainable
• Missing skills alone is NOT a dealbreaker
• Consider: Do you have time/resources to develop them?
• Consider: Are they better than who you could get at this level?

DECISION PROMPT:
"If I invested 6 months in developing this person,
what could they become? Is that worth the investment?"
```

### Scenario 3: The Overqualified Candidate

```
SITUATION:
They're great - maybe too great. You worry they'll get bored
or leave quickly.

GUIDANCE:
• Ask directly: "Why this role at this stage?"
• Probe: What do they actually want?
• Consider: Maybe they're exactly right for this moment
• Risk: They may outgrow the role quickly

DECISION PROMPT:
"If they leave in 18 months, would the 18 months of great work
be worth it?" Often the answer is yes.
```

### Scenario 4: The "Great but Different" Candidate

```
SITUATION:
They're not what you pictured but are impressive in different ways.
They'd do the job differently than you imagined.

GUIDANCE:
• Different ≠ Wrong (might be better)
• Check: Is your job description too narrow?
• Ask: Would their approach actually work?
• Consider: Are you being too rigid?

DECISION PROMPT:
"Am I rejecting them because they're wrong,
or because they're just different from what I expected?"
```

### Scenario 5: The Gut vs. Data Conflict

```
SITUATION:
Your gut says no but the scores say yes
(or vice versa)

GUIDANCE:
• Neither gut nor data should be ignored
• Gut often picks up on things hard to articulate
• Data ensures you're not just pattern-matching

IF GUT IS NEGATIVE, DATA IS POSITIVE:
• What specifically is bothering you?
• Is there a dimension you didn't score?
• Have someone else interview to validate

IF GUT IS POSITIVE, DATA IS WEAK:
• Why are you excited despite low scores?
• Are you weighting something more heavily?
• What would have to be true for them to succeed?

DECISION PROMPT:
"If I ignore my gut and hire, what could go wrong?"
"If I ignore the data and hire, what am I missing?"

│                                                                 │
│  MISTAKE: Hiring to fill the seat, not fill the need           │
│  SYMPTOM: "We just need someone"                               │
│  FIX: Wait. Bad hire costs more than empty seat.               │
│                                                                 │
│  MISTAKE: Ignoring concerns because you like them              │
│  SYMPTOM: "I'm sure it'll be fine"                             │
│  FIX: Like them AND be confident. Both required.               │
│                                                                 │
│  MISTAKE: Overvaluing experience, undervaluing values          │
│  SYMPTOM: "Their resume is perfect"                            │
│  FIX: Past success ≠ future fit. Values matter more.           │
│                                                                 │
│  MISTAKE: Deciding too quickly (gut only)                      │
│  SYMPTOM: "I knew in the first 5 minutes"                      │
│  FIX: Complete the process. Gut can be wrong.                  │
│                                                                 │
│  MISTAKE: Deciding too slowly (analysis paralysis)             │
│  SYMPTOM: "Let's do one more round"                            │
│  FIX: Set a deadline. Great candidates won't wait forever.     │
│                                                                 │
│  MISTAKE: Letting one great thing overshadow concerns          │
│  SYMPTOM: "Yes but they're SO good at [one thing]"            │
│  FIX: Score dimensions separately. Don't let halo effect win.  │
│                                                                 │

```

### If You Decide to PASS

```
NEXT STEPS:
□ Communicate decline promptly and kindly
□ Keep door open if appropriate ("not right now")
□ Learn from this search (update criteria?)

□ Don't second-guess unless new info emerges

SAMPLE DECLINE MESSAGE:
"Thank you for the time you invested in interviewing with us.
After careful consideration, we've decided to move forward with
another candidate whose experience more closely matches our
current needs. We were impressed by [genuine positive], and I
wish you the best in your search."
```

## The One-Page Decision Guide

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                 HIRING DECISION: ONE-PAGE GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HIRE if:
✓ Values score 4+ (no dealbreakers)
✓ All dimensions 3+
✓ References positive
✓ You're genuinely excited
✓ No unresolved concerns
✓ You'd bet on them

PASS if:
✗ Values score below 3 (or any 1)
✗ Multiple dimensions below 3
✗ Reference red flags
✗ Unshakeable concerns
✗ You're settling
✗ Gut says no

EXPLORE MORE if:
? You have a SPECIFIC unanswered question
? And knowing the answer would change your decision
? And you haven't already explored multiple times

THE GOLDEN RULES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. When in doubt, don't
2. Values can't be trained
3. The cost of bad hire > cost of empty seat
4. "Maybe" is not a decision
5. If you have to convince yourself, that's a no
