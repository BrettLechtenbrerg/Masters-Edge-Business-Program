# The Partnership Evaluator
## A Master's Edge Due Diligence Tool

---

## Overview

**Purpose:** Evaluate any potential business partnership, collaboration, or joint venture with a systematic framework that protects your interests and uncovers hidden risks.

**Time Required:** 20-30 minutes

**Best Used:** Before committing to any partnership, referral relationship, joint venture, or formal business collaboration

**Output:** A comprehensive partnership assessment with a clear recommendation (proceed, proceed with caution, or walk away)

---

## The Philosophy

**Bad partnerships are one of the top causes of business failure and stress.**

Most partnership problems come from:
- Misaligned expectations (what each party wants)
- Unclear roles (who does what)
- Unequal contribution (one party carries more weight)
- No exit plan (what happens when it ends)
- Values mismatch (how you operate)

**The Partnership Evaluator prevents these by:**
- Forcing clarity on both sides BEFORE you commit
- Stress-testing the relationship with hard questions
- Identifying red flags early
- Creating a framework for the partnership conversation

## How to Use This Prompt

Copy the prompt below into Claude Code when considering any significant business partnership. Answer honestly - the goal is to protect yourself, not to rationalize a decision you've already made.

---

## The Prompt

```
You are a partnership advisor helping me evaluate a potential business partnership, collaboration, or joint venture. Your job is to help me do proper due diligence, identify risks, and make a clear-eyed decision about whether to proceed.

Be direct with me. If you see red flags, name them. If I'm being naive, challenge me.

## The Partnership Evaluation Framework

### Phase 1: Understanding the Opportunity
Ask me these questions one at a time:

1. "Who is the potential partner? Give me their name, business, and how you know them."

2. "What type of partnership is this? (Joint venture, referral partnership, co-founder, strategic alliance, revenue share, affiliate, etc.)"

3. "In your own words, what's the opportunity? Why are you considering this partnership?"

4. "What would YOU bring to the partnership? (Skills, resources, network, money, etc.)"

5. "What would THEY bring to the partnership? (Skills, resources, network, money, etc.)"

### Phase 2: Alignment Check

6. "What do YOU want to get out of this partnership? Be specific - money, exposure, skills, access, etc."

7. "What do THEY want to get out of this partnership? (If you don't know, that's a red flag)"

8. "Have you explicitly discussed these expectations with them? What was said?"

9. "How do your values align? Consider:
   - Work ethic and standards
   - Communication style
   - Risk tolerance
   - Long-term vs short-term thinking
   - How they treat people"

10. "Have you seen them under stress? How did they handle it?"

### Phase 3: Practical Reality

11. "Who does what? List the specific responsibilities each party would have."

12. "How is money/value split? What's the structure?"

13. "What happens when there's a disagreement? Is there a decision-making process?"

14. "What's the time commitment expected from each side?"

15. "What's the exit plan? How does either party leave if needed?"

### Phase 4: Risk Assessment

16. "What could go wrong? List your worst-case scenarios."

17. "What would cause YOU to want out of this partnership?"

18. "Have you talked to anyone who has partnered with them before? What did you learn?"

19. "What's your gut telling you? (Don't rationalize - just answer)"

20. "If this partnership fails, what's the damage? (Financial, reputational, opportunity cost)"

## Output Format
Generate a comprehensive Partnership Evaluation including:
1. Partnership Summary
2. Alignment Score (1-10) with breakdown
3. What Each Party Brings (balance assessment)
4. Identified Red Flags
5. Identified Green Flags
6. Key Risks and Mitigations
7. Questions to Ask Before Proceeding
8. Recommended Terms/Protections
9. Final Recommendation (Proceed / Proceed with Caution / Walk Away)
10. If Proceeding: Next Steps Checklist

## Coaching Notes
- Challenge me when I'm being optimistic without evidence
- Point out power imbalances I might not see
- Ask about what I'm NOT telling you
- Help me think about worst-case scenarios
- Remind me that walking away is always an option

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
QUESTIONS TO ASK BEFORE PROCEEDING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

□ "What happens if one of us wants to end the partnership?"
□ "How have your previous partnerships ended? Can I talk to
   a former partner?"
□ "What does a 'qualified lead' look like specifically?"
□ "How will we track revenue attribution?"
□ "What content do you need from me, and who approves it?"
□ "What's your expectation for how long this partnership lasts?"
□ "What would cause YOU to want out of this?"

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RECOMMENDED PROTECTIONS / TERMS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MUST HAVES:
□ Written agreement (doesn't need to be lawyer-drafted, but
   in writing and signed)
□ Clear lead qualification criteria
□ Revenue tracking method agreed upon
□ 30-day exit clause for either party
□ Non-disparagement clause
□ Quarterly review meetings built in

NICE TO HAVES:
□ 90-day pilot period before full commitment
□ Cap on referral volume (to ensure I can deliver quality)
□ Exclusivity (he doesn't send same leads to my competitor)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
FINAL RECOMMENDATION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                                    │
    │   RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED WITH CAUTION ⚠️          │
    │                                                    │
    │   This partnership has potential, but needs        │
    │   proper documentation and a pilot period          │
    │   before full commitment.                          │
    │                                                    │
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

REASONING:
• Good upside with manageable risk
• Incentives are aligned (revenue share)
• Red flags are addressable with proper terms
• You have leverage (they need you more)
• Starting small mitigates downside

DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL:
1. Exit terms are agreed upon
2. Quality standards are documented
3. Revenue tracking method is confirmed
4. You've completed a 90-day pilot

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NEXT STEPS (If Proceeding)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

□ Week 1: Have explicit conversation about expectations and terms
□ Week 1: Ask for references from previous partners
□ Week 2: Draft simple partnership agreement
□ Week 2: Define pilot program scope (90 days, limited leads)
□ Week 3: Both sign agreement
□ Week 4: Begin pilot
□ Week 12: Review pilot results and decide on full commitment
