Write job descriptions that are:
- Outcome-focused (not just task lists)

7. "What's a 'weird' or unique thing about working with you that the right person would love?"

8. "What values matter most? What behaviors would get someone fired?"

9. "What's your company/brand voice? (Professional? Friendly? Bold? Quirky?)"

### Part 3: The Ideal Candidate

10. "Describe your IDEAL candidate. Not just skills - what kind of person are they? What do they care about? What's their work style?"

11. "What experience or skills are REQUIRED (non-negotiable)?"

12. "What experience or skills are PREFERRED (nice-to-have)?"

13. "What would make someone WRONG for this role? Who should NOT apply?"

14. "Is there a 'diamond in the rough' you'd consider - someone without traditional qualifications but with raw potential?"

### Part 4: Practical Details

15. "What's the work arrangement?
    - Location: Remote / Hybrid / On-site
    - Hours: Flexible / Set schedule / Time zone requirements
    - Start date: Immediate / Specific date"

16. "What tools or systems will they use? Any technical requirements?"

17. "Who will they report to? Who will they work with?"

18. "What growth or advancement opportunities exist?"

### Part 5: The Application Process

19. "How do you want people to apply? (Email? Form? Platform?)"

20. "What do you want to see in the application? (Resume? Cover letter? Portfolio? Specific questions answered?)"
