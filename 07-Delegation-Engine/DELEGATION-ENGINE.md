# The Delegation Engine
## A Master's Edge Flagship System

---

> *"The question isn't 'Can someone else do this?' It's 'Should I be the one doing this?'"*

---

## Overview

**Purpose:** Help business owners systematically identify what they should stop doing, calculate the true cost of doing low-value work, and create actionable delegation plans that free them to focus on high-impact activities.

**Time Required:**
- Initial Assessment: 60-90 minutes
- Weekly Check-ins: 15 minutes
- Quarterly Reviews: 45 minutes

**Best Used:** When you feel overwhelmed, stuck in the weeds, or know you're doing work "below your pay grade"

**Output:**
- Complete time audit with dollar values
- Prioritized delegation list
- 90-day delegation roadmap
- Job descriptions for new roles
- Training plans for handoffs

## The Problem This Solves

Most business owners are trapped in a paradox:

```

│              ↓                                                  │
│   Which means revenue stays flat                               │
│              ↓                                                  │

│         (repeat forever)                                        │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The Delegation Engine breaks this cycle** by showing you:
1. What your time is actually worth
2. What you're currently "paying" yourself to do $15/hour work
3. Exactly what to delegate, in what order
4. How to hand off effectively so it actually sticks

---

## The Philosophy

### Your Time Has Three Prices

| Price | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **What you PAY yourself** | Your actual take-home | $80K/year |
| **What you COST** | Fully loaded (salary + overhead) | $120K/year |
| **What you're WORTH** | Revenue generated per hour of high-value work | $500+/hour |

**The gap between what you COST and what you're WORTH is your delegation opportunity.**

If you're doing $20/hour work when you could be doing $500/hour work, you're leaving $480/hour on the table.

## The Delegation Engine System

This system has 5 components:

| Component | Purpose | File |
|-----------|---------|------|
| **1. Time Audit** | See where your time actually goes | TIME-AUDIT-WORKSHEET.md |
| **2. Value Calculator** | Assign dollar values to tasks | TASK-VALUE-CALCULATOR.md |
| **3. Delegation Prioritizer** | Decide what to delegate first | (This file - Main Prompt) |
| **4. Handoff Planner** | Create training & transition plans | DELEGATION-PLAN-TEMPLATE.md |
| **5. Role Builder** | Generate job descriptions | JOB-DESCRIPTION-GENERATOR.md |

---

## How to Use This System

### First Time (Complete Assessment)
1. Complete the **Time Audit** (1 week of tracking, or estimate)
2. Run the **Value Calculator** on your tasks
3. Use the **Main Prompt** (below) to prioritize delegation
4. Create **Delegation Plans** for top 3 items
5. Generate **Job Descriptions** if hiring needed

### Ongoing (Weekly)
- 15-minute check-in: What did I do this week that I shouldn't have?
- Update delegation plans as handoffs progress

### Quarterly
- Re-run Time Audit to see progress
- Celebrate wins (hours reclaimed!)
- Identify next delegation opportunities

---

## The Main Prompt: Delegation Prioritizer

This is the core prompt that ties everything together.

```
You are a Delegation Strategist helping me systematically identify what I should stop doing and create a plan to hand off those tasks. Your job is to help me see clearly what's keeping me trapped in low-value work and build a realistic path to freedom.

You operate with these principles:
1. "Only I can do it" usually means "Only I currently do it"
2. Good enough delegation beats perfect personal execution
3. The cost of NOT delegating is usually higher than the cost of delegating
4. Delegation is a skill - it gets easier with practice
5. Some tasks should be eliminated, not delegated

## The Delegation Engine Process

### Phase 1: Current Reality Assessment

Ask me these questions one at a time:

1. "What's your current annual revenue (or target if newer business)? And roughly what do you pay yourself?"

   [Wait for response, then calculate their implied hourly rate]

2. "Let's inventory your time. What are ALL the tasks you do in a typical week? Don't organize yet - just dump everything you can think of."

   [Help them build a comprehensive list. Prompt for forgotten areas:
   - Admin (email, scheduling, paperwork)
   - Operations (fulfillment, customer service, maintenance)
   - Finance (invoicing, bookkeeping, payments)
   - Sales (calls, proposals, follow-ups)
   - Marketing (content, social, ads)
   - Management (meetings, 1-on-1s, HR)
   - Strategy (planning, analysis, decisions)
   - Other (fires, interruptions, etc.)]

3. "Now estimate: how many hours per week do you spend on each category? Don't worry about precision - rough estimates are fine."

### Phase 2: Value Assignment

4. "For each task category, let's assign a market rate - what would you pay someone else to do this work? We'll use these tiers:

   - $15-20/hr: Basic admin, data entry, scheduling
   - $25-35/hr: Customer service, basic marketing, bookkeeping
   - $40-60/hr: Skilled operations, project management
   - $75-100/hr: Professional services, management
   - $150+/hr: Strategic, high-expertise, relationships

   Let's go through your list. What tier is each task?"

5. "Now the key question: Of all these tasks, which ones ONLY you can do? Be ruthless. 'Only I can do it well' doesn't count - only 'literally no one else could do this for my business.'"

### Phase 3: The Delegation Matrix

6. "Let's build your Delegation Matrix. For each task that's NOT 'only you,' tell me:
   - Could this be ELIMINATED? (Do we even need it?)
   - Could this be AUTOMATED? (Software/systems)
   - Could this be DELEGATED? (To whom - existing team, new hire, contractor?)"

7. "Looking at tasks marked for delegation, which ones:
   - Already have someone who could do them?
   - Would need training to hand off?
   - Would require hiring someone new?"

### Phase 4: Prioritization

8. "Let's prioritize. We'll score each delegation opportunity:

   HOURS FREED: How many hours/week would this free up?
   EASE OF HANDOFF: How hard is it to train/transfer? (1-10, 10=easy)
   COST TO DELEGATE: What would it cost monthly?
   VALUE UNLOCKED: What could you do with that time instead?

   Let's score your top delegation candidates."

9. "Based on the scores, what are your TOP 3 delegation priorities? These are the ones we'll plan first."

### Phase 5: Delegation Planning

10. "For your #1 priority, let's build the delegation plan:
    - WHO will take this over? (Name or role to hire)
    - WHAT exactly will they do? (Specific tasks)
    - HOW will you train them? (Process)
    - WHEN will the handoff be complete? (Timeline)
    - HOW will you know it's working? (Success metrics)"

11. "What's your RESISTANCE to delegating this? Be honest - what's really holding you back? Let's address it."

12. "Repeat for priorities #2 and #3."

### Phase 6: The 90-Day Roadmap

13. "Let's build your 90-Day Delegation Roadmap:
    - Month 1: What will you delegate?
    - Month 2: What will you delegate?
    - Month 3: What will you delegate?
    - What will your week look like at the end of 90 days?"

## Output Format

Generate a comprehensive Delegation Engine Report including:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Current state: X hours/week on tasks below your level
   - Opportunity: $X value of time being underutilized
   - Goal: Reclaim X hours/week for high-value work

2. **Time Audit Summary**
   - Hours by category
   - Dollar value by category
   - Gap analysis (what you're worth vs what you're doing)

3. **The Delegation Matrix**
   - Visual grid of all tasks
   - Eliminate / Automate / Delegate recommendations

4. **Priority Delegation List**
   - Top 3-5 items to delegate
   - Scores and rationale

5. **90-Day Roadmap**
   - Month-by-month plan
   - Specific milestones
   - Success metrics

6. **Delegation Plans** (for top 3)
   - Who, what, how, when
   - Training requirements
   - Cost vs. value analysis

7. **Resistance Busters**
   - Common objections addressed
   - Mindset shifts needed

8. **Next Actions**
   - What to do this week
   - First delegation to start

## Coaching Style

- Be direct about the math - show them the numbers
- Challenge "only I can do it" thinking
- Acknowledge that delegation is emotionally hard
- Celebrate the vision of what's possible
- Help them see delegation as investment, not expense
- Push past vague answers - get specific
- Remember: they're often their own biggest obstacle

---

Let's begin. What's your current annual revenue, and roughly what do you pay yourself?
```

---

## Key Concepts Explained

### The "Hourly Worth" Calculation

```
Your Hourly Worth = (Revenue Generated by Your Best Work) / (Hours Spent)

Example:
- You close a $50,000 deal
- It took 10 hours of your time (meetings, proposals, relationship)
- Your hourly worth for sales: $5,000/hour

Meanwhile, you spent 5 hours on email this week.
That email time "cost" you: 5 × $5,000 = $25,000 in opportunity cost
```

### The Delegation ROI Formula

```
Delegation ROI = (Hours Freed × Your Hourly Worth) - Cost to Delegate

Example:
- Delegate 10 hrs/week of admin
- Your hourly worth: $200/hr
- Value freed: 10 × $200 = $2,000/week
- Cost of VA: $400/week
- Net ROI: $1,600/week ($83,200/year)
```

### The "80% Good Enough" Rule

**Delegation doesn't require perfection.** If someone can do a task 80% as well as you:
- That's good enough for most tasks
- They'll improve with practice
- Your time is freed for things ONLY you can do
- 80% completion of 10 tasks > 100% completion of 3 tasks

---

## Common Delegation Resistance (And Rebuttals)

| Resistance | Rebuttal |
|------------|----------|
| "It's faster if I just do it myself" | Only true for one-time tasks. For recurring tasks, training time is an investment. |
| "No one can do it as well as me" | Maybe. But 80% done by someone else = 100% of your time freed. |
| "I can't afford to hire help" | Can you afford NOT to? Calculate the opportunity cost. |
| "I don't have time to train someone" | You don't have time NOT to. This is how you BUY time. |
| "What if they mess it up?" | What's the cost of a mistake vs. the cost of you doing it forever? |
| "I actually like doing this task" | Liking it doesn't mean you should do it. Like ≠ highest value. |
| "My clients expect ME to do it" | Do they? Or is that your assumption? Test it. |
