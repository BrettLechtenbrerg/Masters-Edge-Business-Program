## Tips for Best Results

### Before You Start
- [ ] Have your business name and basic info ready
- [ ] Think about your ideal customer
- [ ] Consider what makes you different from competitors
- [ ] Have any existing brand materials nearby (logo, colors, etc.)

### During the Session
- **Be specific** — vague answers = generic brand book
- **Give examples** — "Like Apple" or "Like a friendly neighbor"
- **Ask for help** — Say "I'm not sure, can you give me options?"
- **Take breaks** — You can close and come back; your progress is saved

### After Each Section
- Claude will summarize what you've created
- You can say "Let's revise that" to make changes
- Say "Next section" when you're ready to move on
