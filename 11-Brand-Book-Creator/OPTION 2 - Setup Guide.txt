HOW TO BUILD YOUR BRAND BOOK
OPTION 2: WORKBOOK METHOD
============================================

This method lets you fill out a workbook at your own
pace, then use AI to turn your answers into a polished,
professional brand book.

Works with: Claude (claude.ai) or ChatGPT (chat.openai.com)

Time: 30-60 minutes for the workbook, 5 minutes for AI


============================================

STEP 1: FILL OUT YOUR WORKBOOK

Open "OPTION 2 - Brand Book Workbook.txt"

Go through all 15 sections and fill in your answers.
Take your time — there's no rush. You can save and
come back to it whenever you want.

TIPS:
  - Write naturally, like you're talking to a friend
  - Skip sections you're unsure about (the AI will help)
  - Short answers are totally fine
  - Don't overthink it — honest beats perfect


============================================

STEP 2: OPEN YOUR AI TOOL

Go to one of these:
  - Claude: claude.ai
  - ChatGPT: chat.openai.com

Start a new conversation.


============================================

STEP 3: PASTE THE SYNTHESIS PROMPT

Open "OPTION 2 - Paste This With Your Answers.txt"

Copy ONLY the text between START and STOP.
Paste it into the chat.
Press Enter.


============================================

STEP 4: PASTE YOUR WORKBOOK ANSWERS

Now go back to your completed workbook.
Select ALL of your answers (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A).
Paste them into the same chat.
Press Enter.


============================================

STEP 5: GET YOUR BRAND BOOK

The AI will read everything you wrote and start creating
your polished brand book in whichever formats you
selected in Section 15 of the workbook.

It will create one version at a time and ask if you're
ready for the next one.


============================================

WHICH OPTION IS RIGHT FOR ME?

OPTION 1 (Guided Conversation):
  - AI asks you questions one at a time
  - Like having a consultant walk you through it
  - Best if you like being guided step by step
  - Takes 45-90 minutes in one sitting

OPTION 2 (This Workbook Method):
  - You fill out a workbook at your own pace
  - AI polishes your answers into a brand book
  - Best if you like to think before you write
  - Fill out over days/weeks, then 5 min with AI


============================================

TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS

  - Fill in as many sections as you can
  - The more you give the AI, the better your brand book
  - You can always ask the AI to revise something
  - Say "make that sound more like me" if anything
    feels too corporate or generic
  - If you skipped sections, the AI will suggest answers
    based on everything else you shared
