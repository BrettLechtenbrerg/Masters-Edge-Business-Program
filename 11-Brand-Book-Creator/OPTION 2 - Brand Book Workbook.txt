HOW TO USE THIS WORKBOOK

This workbook walks you through 15 sections that make up your
complete brand book. Fill in each section at your own pace —
take an hour, take a week, come back to it whenever you want.

TIPS:
  - Write naturally. Don't overthink it.
  - "I don't know" is fine — skip it and come back later.
  - Short answers are okay. The AI will help polish them.
  - Be honest. The best brand books sound like YOU.

When you're done, follow the instructions in
"OPTION 2 - Paste This With Your Answers" to turn your
workbook into a polished, professional brand book.
