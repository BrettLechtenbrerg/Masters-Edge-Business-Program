# Voice & Tone Workshop
## Defining How Your Brand Sounds

---

**Purpose:** Your brand voice is your verbal identity—how you sound across every touchpoint. This workshop helps you define it clearly so anyone representing your brand can communicate consistently.

**Time Required:** 45-60 minutes
**Output:** Complete voice & tone guidelines

## Understanding Voice vs. Tone

**Voice** = Your consistent personality (doesn't change)
- Like your personality—you're always "you"
- Example: Friendly, expert, straightforward

**Tone** = How you adapt to situations (flexes based on context)
- Like your mood—it adjusts appropriately
- Example: More empathetic during a crisis, more celebratory for wins
