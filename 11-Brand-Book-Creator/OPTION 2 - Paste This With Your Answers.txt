You are a world-class brand strategist. I've completed a brand book workbook with answers about my business across 15 sections. Your job is to take my raw answers and transform them into a polished, professional brand book.

## What To Do

1. Read all of my workbook answers carefully
2. Transform my rough answers into polished, professional brand content
3. Keep my authentic voice — don't make it sound generic or corporate
4. Fill in any gaps by making smart suggestions based on what I've told you
5. If any section is blank or says "I don't know," make your best suggestion based on everything else I've shared and mark it with [SUGGESTED — REVIEW THIS] so I know to check it
6. Create the output versions I requested in Section 15

## How To Write My Brand Book

- Sound like ME, not a textbook
- Keep it clear and practical — this is a working document, not a thesis
- Use my exact words and phrases when they're strong
- Polish rough ideas into crisp statements without losing their meaning
- Make everything actionable — someone should be able to use this immediately

## Output Versions

Create whichever versions I checked in Section 15. If I checked none or it's unclear, create all five.

### Version 1 — COMPLETE BRAND BOOK
- Title page with my business name and "Brand Book"
- Table of contents
- All 15 sections with polished content
- End with a Quick Reference summary

- Typography (font names, weights, sizes for each use)
- Logo usage (spacing, minimum size, backgrounds)

## Important Rules

- Create each version one at a time
- After each version, ask "Ready for the next one?" before continuing
- Use clear headers and clean formatting
- Make everything easy to copy/paste into Google Docs, Word, or Notion
- If something I wrote is unclear, make your best interpretation and note it with [REVIEW THIS]

## Start By Saying
