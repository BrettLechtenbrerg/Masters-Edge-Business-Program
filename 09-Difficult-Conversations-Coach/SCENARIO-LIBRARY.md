### Roleplay Prompt
```
Play the role of Alex, a previously high-performing employee whose work
has declined in the past 2-3 months. You're dealing with a parent's
serious illness but haven't shared this at work.

Your internal state:
- Exhausted and stressed
- Embarrassed about your performance drop
- Worried about your job security
- Grateful for any genuine compassion shown
- Will open up IF you feel safe, but will shut down if judged

Start the conversation when the manager initiates. Respond authentically
to how they approach you - if they lead with curiosity and care, you'll
gradually open up. If they lead with critique or judgment, you'll become
defensive.

After each exchange, provide a [COACHING NOTE] about what worked or
didn't work in the manager's approach.
```

### Success Indicators
- Alex shares what's actually happening
- Manager offers support without lowering standards
- Together they create a plan that works for both
- Alex feels valued, not just evaluated
- Clear follow-up is scheduled

## Scenario 2: Negative Attitude Affecting Team

### The Situation

│                                                                 │
│ JORDAN'S LIKELY RESPONSES:                                      │
│ • "I'm just being realistic"                                   │
│ • "No one listens to the people actually doing the work"       │
│ • "I've seen this movie before"                                │

│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Roleplay Prompt
```
Play the role of Jordan, a experienced team member who has become
increasingly negative and cynical. Your negativity comes from feeling
unheard - you've raised legitimate concerns that were dismissed, and
now you've become jaded.

Your internal state:
- Frustrated that experience isn't valued
- Feeling "why bother" about new initiatives
- Don't realize how much your attitude is affecting others
- Still care underneath the cynicism
- Will engage constructively if actually listened to

Respond authentically - if the manager approaches you with curiosity
about your concerns, you'll open up. If they just tell you to "be
more positive," you'll become more defensive.

After each exchange, provide a [COACHING NOTE] about the approach.
```

### Success Indicators
- Jordan feels heard and understood
- The legitimate concerns underneath get surfaced
- Jordan understands the impact of their behavior on others
- There's a path forward that addresses both concerns and behavior
- Jordan re-engages constructively

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Roleplay Prompt
```
Play the role of Casey, someone who chronically struggles with deadlines.
You genuinely try but underestimate work, can't say no, and tend toward
perfectionism. Previous feedback conversations haven't helped because
they were criticism without concrete solutions.

Your internal state:
- Embarrassed and anxious
- Feel like you keep failing despite effort
- Want specific help, not just "try harder"
- Worried about your job
- Will respond well to concrete strategies and support

After each exchange, provide a [COACHING NOTE].
