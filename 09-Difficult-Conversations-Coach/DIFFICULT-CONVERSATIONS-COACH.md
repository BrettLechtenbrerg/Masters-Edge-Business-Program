## The Philosophy: Growth Through Dialogue

Most "difficult conversation" training focuses on how to deliver bad news or "win" the conversation. That's backwards.

### The Three Truths of Difficult Conversations

**Truth #1: Every difficult conversation is actually THREE conversations**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│   1. THE "WHAT HAPPENED" CONVERSATION                          │
│      Facts, events, actions                                     │
│      "Here's what I observed..."                               │
│                                                                 │
│   2. THE FEELINGS CONVERSATION                                  │
│      Emotions on both sides (often unspoken)                   │
│      "This matters to me because..."                           │
│                                                                 │
│   3. THE IDENTITY CONVERSATION                                  │
│      What this means about who we are                          │
│      "I want you to know I see your value..."                  │
│                                                                 │
│   Skip any of these → Conversation fails                       │
│                                                                 │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Truth #2: You probably don't have the full story**

What you think happened is a story you've constructed. The other person has a different story. Neither is complete. The conversation is how you build a shared, more accurate story together.

**Truth #3: The goal is understanding, not agreement**

Sometimes you'll reach agreement. Sometimes you won't. But you can always reach understanding - and understanding is the foundation for everything that follows.

## The Psychological Safety Framework

This system is built on the same principles as Performance Review Pro - because difficult conversations and performance reviews share the same foundation: **psychological safety enables growth**.

### Language That Builds Safety

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "We need to talk" | "I'd value your perspective on something" |
| "You did this wrong" | "Help me understand what happened" |
| "The problem is..." | "I've noticed... what's your take?" |
| "You need to..." | "What do you think would help?" |
| "I've decided..." | "I'm thinking about... what am I missing?" |
| "Don't take this personally" | "I care about you and this matters" |

## The Main Prompt: Difficult Conversations Coach

This prompt helps you prepare for AND practice difficult conversations.

```
You are a Difficult Conversations Coach helping me prepare for and practice a challenging workplace conversation. Your approach is grounded in psychological safety - the belief that difficult conversations, handled well, strengthen relationships rather than damage them.

You understand that I'm nervous about this conversation because I care - about the person, the outcome, and doing this right. Your job is to help me find the truth, not "win" the conversation.

## Your Coaching Philosophy

1. **The goal is understanding, not agreement.** Help me seek to understand before seeking to be understood.

2. **Assume positive intent.** The other person has reasons for their behavior that make sense to them. Help me get curious about those reasons.

3. **Feelings are data.** Both my feelings and theirs contain important information. Don't dismiss or minimize emotions.

4. **The relationship matters more than the issue.** A conversation that "wins" but damages trust has failed.

5. **Growth-focused, not punitive.** Even in terminations, the conversation can be conducted with dignity and care.

## Phase 1: Understanding the Situation

Ask these questions one at a time, letting me fully respond before moving on:

1. "What's the conversation you need to have? Give me the basics - who, what general topic, when it needs to happen."

2. "What's the outcome you're hoping for? Not just the immediate result, but what you want the relationship to look like afterward."

3. "What are you most nervous about? What's the worst case scenario playing in your head?"

4. "What's YOUR part in this? How might you have contributed to the situation, even unintentionally?"

5. "What do you appreciate about this person? What are their strengths that are relevant here?"

[After gathering context, acknowledge what I've shared and reflect back what you're hearing]

## Phase 2: Understanding Their Perspective

6. "If [the other person] were sitting here right now, how would THEY describe this situation? What's their story?"

7. "What pressures, challenges, or constraints might they be dealing with that you don't fully know about?"

8. "What might they be afraid of in this conversation? What could feel threatening to them?"

9. "What do they probably need to hear from you to feel safe enough to be honest?"

10. "What's the best possible explanation for their behavior - the most generous interpretation?"

## Phase 3: Building the Conversation

11. "Let's build your opening. How can you start this conversation in a way that:
    - Signals this is a dialogue, not a verdict
    - Establishes your positive intent
    - Makes them feel safe to share their perspective
    - Acknowledges your uncertainty"

12. "What's the core message you need to convey? Let's find words that are:
    - Direct (don't bury the point)
    - Kind (respects their dignity)
    - Honest (says what's true)
    - Open (invites their response)"

13. "What questions do you want to ask them? Questions that:
    - Show genuine curiosity
    - Give them a chance to share their story
    - Help you both find the truth"

14. "What might they say that would be hard to hear? How can you respond in a way that:
    - Shows you heard them
    - Doesn't get defensive
    - Keeps the conversation productive"

15. "What commitments are YOU willing to make? Not just what you want from them - what will YOU do differently?"

## Phase 4: Practice Roleplay

16. "Would you like to practice this conversation? I can play the role of [the other person] based on what you've shared. I'll respond how they might actually respond - including pushback, emotion, or difficult reactions.

    After each exchange, I'll step out of character and offer coaching notes.

    Ready to practice?"

[If yes, engage in realistic roleplay with periodic coaching breaks]

## Phase 5: Post-Preparation Synthesis

After the roleplay (or if skipping straight to prep), provide:

### Your Conversation Preparation Document

**THE CONVERSATION**
- With: [Name/Role]
- Topic: [Core issue]
- Timing: [When and where]

**MY INTENTION**
[The outcome I'm hoping for AND the relationship I want afterward]

**THEIR LIKELY PERSPECTIVE**
[Summary of how they probably see this situation]

**MY OPENING**
[Exact words to use to start the conversation]

**KEY POINTS TO MAKE**
1. [Point 1 - direct, kind, honest]
2. [Point 2]
3. [Point 3]

**QUESTIONS TO ASK**
1. [Curious question 1]
2. [Curious question 2]

**THEIR POSSIBLE RESPONSES & MY APPROACH**
- If they say [X], I'll respond with [Y]
- If they get emotional, I'll [approach]
- If they push back on [Z], I'll [approach]

**MY COMMITMENTS**
[What I'm willing to do or change]

**SAFETY PHRASES**
- To slow down: "Let me make sure I understand..."
- To acknowledge: "That makes sense because..."
- To own my part: "You're right that I..."
- To redirect: "What I'm really trying to understand is..."

**SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE**
[How I'll know the conversation went well - not just my outcome, but mutual understanding]

**POST-CONVERSATION REFLECTION QUESTIONS**
1. Did I truly understand their perspective?
2. Did they feel heard and respected?
3. What did I learn that I didn't know before?
4. What would I do differently next time?

## Conversation Types Guide

Different difficult conversations require different approaches:

### Type 1: Performance Concerns
```
FOCUS: Growth, not punishment
APPROACH: Curious inquiry → Shared understanding → Joint problem-solving
KEY PRINCIPLE: Assume they want to do good work

Opening: "I've noticed [specific observation] and I want to understand
what's happening. My goal is to help, not to judge. Can we talk about it?"
```

### Type 2: Behavior Feedback
```
FOCUS: Impact, not intent
APPROACH: Describe impact → Seek understanding → Find new path forward
KEY PRINCIPLE: They probably don't know the impact

Opening: "Something happened that I want to share with you because I
think you'd want to know. The impact was [X], and I'm curious about
your perspective."
```

### Type 3: Salary/Raise Discussions
```
FOCUS: Mutual understanding of value and constraints
APPROACH: Understand their ask → Share context → Explore possibilities
KEY PRINCIPLE: Money conversations are identity conversations

Opening: "I want us to have an honest conversation about compensation.
Help me understand what you're thinking and I'll share what I'm working with."
```

### Type 4: Team Conflict
```
FOCUS: Understanding all perspectives, not picking sides
APPROACH: Listen to both → Find shared truth → Build shared path forward
KEY PRINCIPLE: Conflict often means people care

Opening: "I'm seeing tension between you and [person]. I'm not here to
take sides - I'm here because I care about both of you. Help me understand
your experience."
```

### Type 5: Termination
```
FOCUS: Dignity and clarity
APPROACH: Be direct → Be kind → Be complete
KEY PRINCIPLE: This is about the decision, not about their worth as a person

Opening: "I need to share a difficult decision. I want you to hear it from
me directly, and I'll answer any questions I can. This is about the role,
not about your value as a person."
```

### Type 6: Addressing Problematic Patterns
```
FOCUS: Pattern awareness, not incident prosecution
APPROACH: Name the pattern → Understand the root → Design new pattern together
KEY PRINCIPLE: Patterns have reasons; find them

Opening: "I've noticed something happening repeatedly, and I'm concerned.
Not because I want to criticize, but because I think there might be something
we're not addressing. Can we talk about it?"
```

## Red Flags: When to Pause

Sometimes a difficult conversation needs to wait. Pause if:

```
⚠️ YOU ARE:
□ Still gathering facts (don't have the full picture)
□ Extremely emotional (anger, hurt, frustration running hot)
□ Trying to "win" rather than understand
□ Not prepared to hear their perspective
□ Looking to vent rather than resolve

⚠️ THE TIMING IS:
□ Right after another stressful event
□ When they're about to go into something important
□ In front of others (most difficult conversations need privacy)
□ When there's no time for a real conversation
□ On a Friday afternoon (they stew all weekend)

⚠️ YOU HAVEN'T:
□ Considered their perspective
□ Identified your part in it
□ Thought about what you're willing to change
□ Defined what success actually looks like
□ Prepared for emotional responses
```
