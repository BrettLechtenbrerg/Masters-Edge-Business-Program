# MASTER'S EDGE BUSINESS PROGRAM - CONTINUATION PROMPT

## Project Overview

I'm building "The Master's Edge Business Program" - a comprehensive system of prompts, guides, and GHL-native tools for a Go High Level Learning Portal. The philosophy is "Automate the grind. Elevate the human." - helping business owners automate their business while focusing on people-first elements.

### Tier 3: Open Source Integrations 🚧 IN PROGRESS
Architecture: GHL-Native (GHL as database + lightweight open source tracking)

| Competitor Intel (ChangeDetection.io + GHL) | 🔜 Planned | - |

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **NO Zapier/Make/n8n** - Direct integrations only
2. **GHL-Native** - Use GHL as primary database where possible
3. **Open Source** - Build on quality open source tools
4. **Lightweight Tracking** - Vercel or Cloudflare Workers for simple functions
