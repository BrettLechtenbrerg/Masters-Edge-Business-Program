# MASTER'S EDGE BUSINESS PROGRAM — CONTINUATION PROMPT
# Last Updated: January 28, 2026

## Who I Am

I'm Brett Lechtenberg, co-founder of Total Success AI (with Manny Torres).
I'm building "The Master's Edge Business Program" — a comprehensive system of
prompts, guides, and GHL-native tools for a Go High Level Learning Portal.

Philosophy: "Automate the grind. Elevate the human."

## Primary Project Location

/Users/brettlechtenberg/Desktop/Claude Projects/Masters Edge Business Program/

GitHub: https://github.com/BrettLechtenbrerg/Masters-Edge-Business-Program
Branch: main (all work is on main)
Latest commit: 8c2d318

## CRITICAL RULES (Follow These Always)

1. NEVER use Zapier, Make, or n8n — direct integrations only
2. Use high-quality open source options
3. GHL should handle as much data storage as possible
4. File names must be simple and clear for non-techy people
5. Quality products are the main concern
6. All workbooks must match the design language of the No-Show Killer Workshop Manual
   (Total Success AI branded, time estimates, YOUR STEPS, OUTCOME banners, footer branding)
7. Keep all files in the Masters Edge Business Program folder
8. Follow naming conventions: UPPERCASE-WITH-HYPHENS.md
9. Update PROJECT-MANIFEST.md when adding new content
10. Commit and push to GitHub when finishing significant work
