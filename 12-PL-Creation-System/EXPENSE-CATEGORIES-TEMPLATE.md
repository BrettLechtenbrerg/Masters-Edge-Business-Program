**Time Required:** 20-30 minutes to customize for your business

## Part 1: Understanding Expense Types

### Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) vs. Operating Expenses

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **COGS (Direct Costs)** | Costs directly tied to delivering product/service | Materials, direct labor, subcontractors |
| **Operating Expenses** | Costs of running the business regardless of sales | Rent, salaries, utilities, marketing |

**The Test:** "If I sell one more unit, does this cost go up?"
- Yes → COGS
- No → Operating Expense

### Fixed vs. Variable Costs

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Fixed** | Stay the same regardless of volume | Rent, salaries, insurance |
| **Variable** | Change based on volume | Materials, commissions, credit card fees |
| **Semi-Variable** | Fixed base with variable component | Utilities, phone, some labor |
