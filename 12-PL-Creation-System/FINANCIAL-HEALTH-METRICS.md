## Part 2: Profitability Metrics

### Gross Profit Margin

**What it measures:** How much you keep after direct costs (efficiency of your core offering)

**Formula:**
```
Gross Profit Margin = (Revenue - COGS) ÷ Revenue × 100

Example:
Revenue: $500,000
COGS: $200,000
Gross Profit: $300,000
Gross Margin: $300,000 ÷ $500,000 = 60%
```

**Industry Benchmarks:**

| Industry | Poor | Average | Good | Excellent |
|----------|------|---------|------|-----------|
| Software/SaaS | <60% | 60-70% | 70-80% | >80% |
| Professional Services | <40% | 40-50% | 50-65% | >65% |
| Retail | <20% | 20-30% | 30-45% | >45% |
| Restaurant | <55% | 55-65% | 65-75% | >75% |
| Construction | <15% | 15-25% | 25-35% | >35% |
| Manufacturing | <20% | 20-30% | 30-40% | >40% |

**What to do if low:**
- [ ] Raise prices
- [ ] Negotiate supplier costs
- [ ] Improve production efficiency
- [ ] Change product/service mix toward higher-margin offerings
- [ ] Reduce waste/returns

---

### Operating Profit Margin (EBIT Margin)

**What it measures:** Profitability after all operating costs (not including interest and taxes)

**Formula:**
```
Operating Margin = Operating Profit ÷ Revenue × 100

Where Operating Profit = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses

Example:
Gross Profit: $300,000
Operating Expenses: $200,000
Operating Profit: $100,000
Revenue: $500,000
Operating Margin: $100,000 ÷ $500,000 = 20%
```

**Benchmarks:**

| Industry | Poor | Average | Good | Excellent |
|----------|------|---------|------|-----------|
| Software/SaaS | <10% | 10-20% | 20-30% | >30% |
| Professional Services | <10% | 10-15% | 15-25% | >25% |
| Retail | <3% | 3-6% | 6-10% | >10% |
| Restaurant | <5% | 5-10% | 10-15% | >15% |
| Construction | <5% | 5-8% | 8-12% | >12% |

**What to do if low:**
- [ ] Review all overhead expenses
- [ ] Improve gross margin (see above)
- [ ] Automate processes
- [ ] Renegotiate contracts (rent, subscriptions, etc.)
- [ ] Reduce headcount or restructure roles

---

### Net Profit Margin

**What it measures:** What's left after everything—your true bottom line

**Formula:**
```
Net Profit Margin = Net Profit ÷ Revenue × 100

Example:
Net Profit: $60,000
Revenue: $500,000
Net Margin: $60,000 ÷ $500,000 = 12%
```

**Benchmarks:**

| Industry | Poor | Average | Good | Excellent |
|----------|------|---------|------|-----------|
| Software/SaaS | <5% | 5-15% | 15-25% | >25% |
| Professional Services | <5% | 5-10% | 10-20% | >20% |
| Retail | <1% | 1-3% | 3-5% | >5% |
| Restaurant | <2% | 2-6% | 6-10% | >10% |
| Construction | <2% | 2-5% | 5-8% | >8% |

**What to do if low:**
- [ ] All margin improvement strategies above
- [ ] Review tax strategy with CPA
- [ ] Refinance high-interest debt
- [ ] Evaluate capital structure

---

### EBITDA Margin

**What it measures:** Cash-generating ability of operations (what acquirers/lenders care about)

**Formula:**
```
EBITDA Margin = EBITDA ÷ Revenue × 100

Where EBITDA = Operating Profit + Depreciation + Amortization

Example:
Operating Profit: $100,000
Depreciation: $20,000
Amortization: $5,000
EBITDA: $125,000
Revenue: $500,000
EBITDA Margin: $125,000 ÷ $500,000 = 25%
```

**Why it matters:**
- Valuation multiple often applied to EBITDA
- Shows core business performance
- Removes effects of financing and accounting choices

---

## Part 3: Growth Metrics

### Revenue Growth Rate

**What it measures:** How fast your business is expanding

**Formulas:**
```
Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth = (This Year - Last Year) ÷ Last Year × 100

Month-over-Month (MoM) Growth = (This Month - Last Month) ÷ Last Month × 100

CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) = (Ending Value ÷ Beginning Value)^(1/years) - 1

Example YoY:
This Year Revenue: $600,000
Last Year Revenue: $500,000
YoY Growth: ($600K - $500K) ÷ $500K = 20%
```

**Benchmarks by Stage:**

| Stage | Expected Growth | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Startup (0-2 years) | 50-200%+ | Prove concept, find product-market fit |
| Early (2-5 years) | 30-100% | Scale operations |
| Growth (5-10 years) | 15-40% | Optimize and expand |
| Mature (10+ years) | 5-15% | Maintain market position |

---

### Revenue Run Rate

**What it measures:** Annualized revenue based on current performance

**Formula:**
```
Run Rate = Current Period Revenue × Periods per Year

Monthly Run Rate = Monthly Revenue × 12
Quarterly Run Rate = Quarterly Revenue × 4

Example:
March Revenue: $45,000
Run Rate: $45,000 × 12 = $540,000
```

**Caution:** Only reliable for stable, non-seasonal businesses

---

## Part 4: Efficiency Metrics

### Revenue per Employee

**What it measures:** Productivity of your workforce

**Formula:**
```
Revenue per Employee = Annual Revenue ÷ Full-Time Equivalents

Example:
Annual Revenue: $1,200,000
FTEs: 8
Revenue per Employee: $150,000
```

**Benchmarks:**

| Industry | Poor | Average | Good | Excellent |
|----------|------|---------|------|-----------|
| Software/SaaS | <$150K | $150-250K | $250-400K | >$400K |
| Professional Services | <$100K | $100-175K | $175-250K | >$250K |
| Retail | <$75K | $75-125K | $125-175K | >$175K |
| Restaurant | <$50K | $50-75K | $75-100K | >$100K |
| Construction | <$100K | $100-200K | $200-300K | >$300K |

**What to do if low:**
- [ ] Automate repetitive tasks
- [ ] Better tools and systems
- [ ] Training and development
- [ ] Restructure roles
- [ ] Outsource non-core functions

---

### Labor Cost Ratio

**What it measures:** What percentage of revenue goes to labor

**Formula:**
```
Labor Cost Ratio = Total Labor Costs ÷ Revenue × 100

Where Total Labor = Wages + Payroll Taxes + Benefits

Example:
Total Labor: $300,000
Revenue: $1,000,000
Labor Cost Ratio: 30%
```

**Benchmarks:**

| Industry | Poor | Average | Good |
|----------|------|---------|------|
| Software/SaaS | >50% | 35-50% | <35% |
| Professional Services | >60% | 45-60% | <45% |
| Retail | >25% | 15-25% | <15% |
| Restaurant | >35% | 28-35% | <28% |
| Construction | >40% | 25-40% | <25% |

---

### Operating Expense Ratio

**What it measures:** Overhead efficiency

**Formula:**
```
OpEx Ratio = Operating Expenses ÷ Revenue × 100

Example:
Operating Expenses: $250,000
Revenue: $800,000
OpEx Ratio: 31.25%
```

**Target:** Keep OpEx ratio stable or declining as you grow (economies of scale)

---

## Part 5: Liquidity Metrics

### Cash Runway

**What it measures:** How long you can survive on current cash

**Formula:**
```
Cash Runway = Cash on Hand ÷ Monthly Cash Burn

Where Monthly Cash Burn = Monthly Cash Out - Monthly Cash In
(If profitable, use average monthly operating expenses)

Example:
Cash on Hand: $120,000
Monthly Operating Expenses: $30,000
Cash Runway: 4 months
```

**Targets:**

| Situation | Minimum Runway |
|-----------|----------------|
| Stable profitable business | 3 months |
| Growing business | 6 months |
| Seasonal business | 6-9 months |
| Startup/fundraising | 12-18 months |

---

### Quick Ratio (Acid Test)

**What it measures:** Ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory

**Formula:**
```
Quick Ratio = (Cash + Accounts Receivable) ÷ Current Liabilities

Example:
Cash: $50,000
Accounts Receivable: $75,000
Current Liabilities: $100,000
Quick Ratio: $125,000 ÷ $100,000 = 1.25
```

**Interpretation:**

| Ratio | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| <0.5 | Danger - may struggle to pay bills |
| 0.5-1.0 | Tight - need to manage carefully |
| 1.0-2.0 | Healthy - can cover obligations |
| >2.0 | Strong - very liquid (or holding too much cash) |

---

### Current Ratio

**What it measures:** Ability to pay short-term obligations with all current assets

**Formula:**
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities

Current Assets = Cash + A/R + Inventory + Prepaid Expenses

Example:
Current Assets: $200,000
Current Liabilities: $100,000
Current Ratio: 2.0
```

**Target:** 1.5-3.0 for most businesses

---

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio

**What it measures:** Financial leverage and risk

**Formula:**
```
Debt-to-Equity = Total Liabilities ÷ Owner's Equity

Example:
Total Liabilities: $200,000
Owner's Equity: $300,000
D/E Ratio: 0.67
```

**Interpretation:**

| Ratio | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| <0.5 | Conservative - low leverage |
| 0.5-1.0 | Balanced - moderate leverage |
| 1.0-2.0 | Leveraged - more risk |
| >2.0 | High leverage - caution |

---

## Part 6: Customer Metrics (for recurring revenue businesses)

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**What it measures:** Cost to acquire one new customer

**Formula:**
```
CAC = Sales & Marketing Spend ÷ New Customers Acquired

Example:
Marketing Spend: $10,000
New Customers: 50
CAC: $200
```

---

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**What it measures:** Total revenue expected from a customer

**Formula:**
```
LTV = ARPU × Gross Margin × Customer Lifespan

Or: LTV = ARPU × Gross Margin ÷ Churn Rate

Example:
Monthly ARPU: $100
Gross Margin: 70%
Average Lifespan: 24 months
LTV: $100 × 0.70 × 24 = $1,680
```

---

### LTV:CAC Ratio

**What it measures:** Return on customer acquisition investment

**Formula:**
```
LTV:CAC = Lifetime Value ÷ Customer Acquisition Cost

Example:
LTV: $1,680
CAC: $200
LTV:CAC: 8.4:1
```

**Interpretation:**

| Ratio | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| <1:1 | Losing money on customers |
| 1-3:1 | Breaking even to modest return |
| 3-5:1 | Healthy - sustainable growth |
| >5:1 | Excellent - consider investing more in acquisition |

---

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

**What it measures:** Predictable monthly revenue from subscriptions

**Formula:**
```
MRR = Number of Customers × Average Revenue per Customer

Growth = New MRR + Expansion MRR - Churn MRR

Example:
100 customers × $99/month = $9,900 MRR
```

---

### Churn Rate

**What it measures:** Customer/revenue loss rate

**Formula:**
```
Customer Churn = Customers Lost ÷ Starting Customers × 100
Revenue Churn = Revenue Lost ÷ Starting MRR × 100

Example:
Starting Customers: 100
Customers Lost: 5
Churn Rate: 5%
```

**Benchmarks (monthly):**

| Business Type | Good | Average | Poor |
|---------------|------|---------|------|
| B2B SaaS | <2% | 2-5% | >5% |
| B2C SaaS | <5% | 5-8% | >8% |
| Memberships | <3% | 3-6% | >6% |
