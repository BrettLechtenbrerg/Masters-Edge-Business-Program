## Part 2: Revenue Projection Methods

### Method 1: Bottom-Up (Best for New Businesses)

Build revenue from individual activities:

```
BOTTOM-UP FORMULA
Revenue = Units × Price × Conversion Rate × Frequency

Example (Service Business):
├── Hours available per week: 40
├── Billable utilization: 70% = 28 billable hours
├── Hourly rate: $150
├── Weekly revenue: 28 × $150 = $4,200
├── Weeks worked per year: 48
└── Annual revenue: $4,200 × 48 = $201,600
```

**Your Calculation:**
```
Hours/Units available: ______
Utilization rate: ______%
Price per hour/unit: $______
Weekly capacity: ______
Weeks per year: ______
Annual revenue: $______
```

---

### Method 2: Top-Down (Best for Market Entry)

Start with market size and work down to your share:

```
TOP-DOWN FORMULA
Revenue = Market Size × Target Market % × Capture Rate

Example (Local Market):
├── Total addressable market (TAM): $10M (all businesses in area)
├── Serviceable market (SAM): $2M (businesses in your niche)
├── Year 1 capture rate: 2%
├── Year 1 revenue: $2M × 2% = $40,000
├── Year 2 capture rate: 5%
├── Year 2 revenue: $2M × 5% = $100,000
└── Year 3 capture rate: 10%
└── Year 3 revenue: $2M × 10% = $200,000
```

**Your Calculation:**
```
Total addressable market: $______
Your serviceable market: $______
Year 1 capture rate: ______%
Year 1 revenue: $______
Year 2 capture rate: ______%
Year 2 revenue: $______
Year 3 capture rate: ______%
Year 3 revenue: $______
```

---

### Method 3: Customer-Based (Best for Subscription/Retention Models)

Project based on customer acquisition and retention:

```
CUSTOMER-BASED FORMULA
Revenue = (Starting Customers + New - Churned) × ARPU

Example (SaaS/Membership):
├── Starting customers: 0
├── Monthly new customers: 20
├── Monthly churn rate: 5%
├── Average revenue per user (ARPU): $99/month
├── Month 1: 20 customers × $99 = $1,980
├── Month 6: 98 customers × $99 = $9,702
├── Month 12: 156 customers × $99 = $15,444
└── Year 1 total: $98,604
```

**Your Calculation:**
```
Starting customers: ______
Monthly new customers: ______
Churn rate: ______%
ARPU: $______
Year 1 ending customers: ______
Year 1 revenue: $______
```

---

### Method 4: Funnel-Based (Best for Sales-Driven Businesses)

Project based on your sales funnel metrics:

```
FUNNEL-BASED FORMULA
Revenue = Leads × Conversion Rate × Average Deal Size

Example (B2B Sales):
├── Monthly website visitors: 5,000
├── Lead capture rate: 3% = 150 leads
├── Sales qualified rate: 20% = 30 SQLs
├── Close rate: 25% = 7.5 deals
├── Average deal size: $5,000
├── Monthly revenue: 7.5 × $5,000 = $37,500
└── Annual revenue: $37,500 × 12 = $450,000
```

**Your Calculation:**
```
Monthly leads: ______
Qualification rate: ______%
Close rate: ______%
Average deal size: $______
Monthly revenue: $______
Annual revenue: $______
```

---

### Method 5: Capacity-Based (Best for Fixed Capacity Businesses)

Project based on maximum capacity and utilization:

```
CAPACITY-BASED FORMULA
Revenue = Maximum Capacity × Utilization × Price

Example (Restaurant):
├── Seats: 50
├── Turns per day: 3
├── Days open: 6/week × 52 = 312
├── Maximum covers: 50 × 3 × 312 = 46,800
├── Target utilization: 65%
├── Actual covers: 30,420
├── Average check: $35
└── Annual revenue: 30,420 × $35 = $1,064,700
```

**Your Calculation:**
```
Maximum capacity: ______
Turns/cycles: ______
Operating days: ______
Maximum units: ______
Target utilization: ______%
Actual units: ______
Price per unit: $______
Annual revenue: $______
```
