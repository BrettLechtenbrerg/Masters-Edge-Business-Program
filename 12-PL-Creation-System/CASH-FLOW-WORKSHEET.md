# Cash Flow Worksheet
## Understanding When Money Actually Moves

---

**Purpose:** Profit and cash are not the same thing. This worksheet helps you understand when money flows in and out of your business—because businesses don't fail from lack of profit, they fail from lack of cash.

**Time Required:** 30-45 minutes
**Key Insight:** "Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, cash is reality."

## Part 1: Why Cash Flow Matters

### Profit ≠ Cash

A profitable business can run out of cash when:

| Situation | Profit Impact | Cash Impact |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Made a sale on credit | +Revenue | $0 until paid |
| Bought inventory | $0 until sold | -Cash immediately |
| Paid loan principal | $0 (not an expense) | -Cash immediately |
| Recorded depreciation | -Expense | $0 (no cash moves) |
| Collected last month's invoice | $0 (already booked) | +Cash now |
| Prepaid annual insurance | -Monthly expense | -Full year cash upfront |

### The Cash Flow Reality Check

Answer these questions:

1. When you make a sale, how long until you get paid? ______ days
2. When you incur expenses, how long until you pay? ______ days
3. Do you carry inventory? How many days worth? ______ days
4. Do customers pay upfront, at delivery, or after? __________
5. Do you have seasonal peaks that require cash buildup? __________

## Part 2: The Cash Conversion Cycle

### What It Is

The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) measures how long your cash is "tied up" in operations.

```
CCC = DSO + DIO - DPO

Where:
DSO = Days Sales Outstanding (how long to collect from customers)
DIO = Days Inventory Outstanding (how long inventory sits)
DPO = Days Payables Outstanding (how long you take to pay suppliers)
```

### Example Calculations

**Service Business:**
```
DSO: 45 days (customers pay Net 45)
DIO: 0 days (no inventory)
DPO: 30 days (you pay bills Net 30)
CCC: 45 + 0 - 30 = 15 days

Meaning: Cash is tied up for 15 days on average
```

**Product Business:**
```
DSO: 30 days (customers pay Net 30)
DIO: 60 days (2 months of inventory)
DPO: 30 days (you pay suppliers Net 30)
CCC: 30 + 60 - 30 = 60 days

Meaning: Cash is tied up for 60 days on average
```

### Your Cash Conversion Cycle

```
YOUR CALCULATION

## Part 4: Collections Timing

### When Revenue Becomes Cash

| Revenue Type | Collection Pattern |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Cash/Card at Sale | Same day |
| Net 15 | ~20 days (some pay late) |
| Net 30 | ~35-45 days (some pay late) |
| Net 60 | ~70-80 days |
| Subscription (prepaid) | Before service |
| Milestone billing | At milestones |
| Progress billing | Throughout project |
| Upon completion | End of project |

### Collections Worksheet

For each revenue stream, map when cash arrives:

```
COLLECTIONS TIMING

Revenue Stream: ____________________
├── Terms: ____________________
├── Average days to collect: ______ days
├── Collection rate: ______% (what % actually pays on time)
└── Pattern:
    ├── Month of sale: ______%
    ├── Month after: ______%
    └── 2 months after: ______%

Revenue Stream: ____________________
├── Terms: ____________________
├── Average days to collect: ______ days
├── Collection rate: ______%
└── Pattern:
    ├── Month of sale: ______%
    ├── Month after: ______%
    └── 2 months after: ______%
```

### Example: Service Business with Net 30 Terms

If January revenue is $50,000:
- 10% pay immediately: $5,000 in January
- 60% pay in 30-45 days: $30,000 in February
- 25% pay in 45-60 days: $12,500 in March
- 5% pay late or don't pay: $2,500 (write off or collect later)

## Part 7: Cash Buffer Calculation

### How Much Cash Do You Need?

**Rule of Thumb:** 3-6 months of operating expenses

```
CASH BUFFER CALCULATION

MONTHLY OPERATING EXPENSES
├── Payroll: $______
├── Rent: $______
├── Utilities: $______
├── Insurance: $______
├── Loan payments: $______
├── Other fixed: $______
└── TOTAL MONTHLY: $______

BUFFER CALCULATION
├── Minimum (3 months): $______ × 3 = $______
├── Comfortable (4 months): $______ × 4 = $______
├── Conservative (6 months): $______ × 6 = $______
└── Your target: $______

CURRENT CASH: $______
GAP: $______
```

### Additional Buffer Considerations

Add to your buffer if:
- [ ] Highly seasonal business (+2 months)
- [ ] Long collection cycles (+1-2 months)
- [ ] Growth phase requiring investment (+2-3 months)
- [ ] Industry volatility (+1-2 months)
- [ ] Major equipment may need replacing (+cost of replacement)

## Part 8: Cash Flow Improvement Strategies

### Speed Up Cash In

| Strategy | Implementation | Impact |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Faster invoicing | Invoice same day as service/delivery | Collect 15-30 days sooner |
| Shorter terms | Move from Net 30 to Net 15 or Due on Receipt | Collect 15-30 days sooner |
| Deposits/retainers | Require 25-50% upfront | Get cash before work starts |
| Early pay discount | Offer 2% discount for payment in 10 days | Some pay faster |
| Auto-billing | Subscription/recurring billing | Predictable cash flow |
| Accept cards | Even with 3% fee | Get paid instantly |
| Collections process | Systematic follow-up on late payments | Reduce outstanding AR |

### Slow Down Cash Out

| Strategy | Implementation | Impact |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Negotiate terms | Ask suppliers for Net 45-60 | Keep cash 15-30 days longer |
| Time payments | Pay on due date, not early | Maximize float |
| Annual subscriptions | If cash-flush, pay annually for discount | Save 10-20% |
| Lease vs. buy | Spread payments over time | Preserve working capital |
| Line of credit | Have available for emergencies | Bridge gaps |

### Reduce Cash Needs

| Strategy | Implementation | Impact |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Reduce inventory | Just-in-time or dropship | Less cash tied up |
| Improve margins | Higher prices, lower costs | More cash per sale |
| Reduce bad debt | Better credit policies | Keep earned cash |
| Cut unnecessary expenses | Audit subscriptions, negotiate contracts | More retained cash |
